# Cluster Analysis

This repository contains a project focused on performing cluster analysis to group data into meaningful segments. Cluster analysis is a key technique in unsupervised learning, widely used in fields such as marketing, biology, social sciences, and more.

## Table of Contents

1. Hierarchical Clustering
2. K-means

## Project Overview

This project applies clustering techniques to identify patterns and groupings in the dataset. It covers the following steps:

- Preprocessing data to handle missing values, normalization, and outliers.
- Applying clustering algorithms such as K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering.
- Visualizing the clusters for better interpretability.
- Evaluating the clusters using metrics such as silhouette score.

## Prerequisites

To run the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or above
- Libraries:
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - SciPy (optional, for hierarchical clustering)

## Methodology

1. **Clustering Algorithms:**
   - K-Means: Identify compact spherical clusters.
   - Hierarchical Clustering: Visualize cluster hierarchy with dendrograms.

3. **Evaluation Metrics:**
   - Dendrogram
   - The Elbow Method
   - Silhouette Analysis

## Results

Key findings and visualizations will be added here, such as:
- Cluster centers and sizes.
- Visual representation of clusters in 2D/3D space.
